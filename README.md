# Simple ReminderApp
For my matura paper I developed and published this application.

The goal of ReminderApp is simple: it reminds you at a given time on a specific weekday. It’s easy to create a new weekly reminder, you just set a name, specific time and on which weekday it should remind you. That’s it. You don’t have to mark something as done, you don’t even have to open the app. There are no annoying red badges, just a single notification.

~~You can get it for free in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/simple-reminderapp/id922661941?mt=8).~~
